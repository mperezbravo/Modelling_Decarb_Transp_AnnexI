# Annex I — Urban‐Density Diagnostics and Regression Results 
Supplementary material for  
**“Modelling the decarbonization of transport: the relevance of disaggregating transport demand”**  
M. Pérez-Bravo*, P. Linares, A. F. Rodríguez-Matas, J. C. Romero  

This repository hosts the Quarto source file (`Annex_I_Model_Decarb_Transport.qmd`) and the pre-rendered HTML (`index.html`) that make up **Annex I** of the paper.

The annex documents, step-by-step, how metropolitan density and related urban-form indicators are tested as drivers of modal shift in the disaggregated MARKAL-TIMES framework. All data-processing code, full diagnostics referenced in the manuscript are contained here and can be reproduced with a single Quarto render.
