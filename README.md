This repository contains the Quarto source (`Annex_I_Model_Decarb_Transport.qmd`) and the rendered HTML (`index.html`) that together constitute **Annex I** of the paper.

The document traces, step by step, how metropolitan-density and related urban-form metrics are evaluated as drivers of modal shift in our disaggregated MARKAL-TIMES framework. All data-processing scripts and the full set of diagnostics referenced in the manuscript are included and can be reproduced with a single Quarto render.
